Develop a Deep Learning Model to Automatically Translate an ROS form from English to Swahili in Python with Keras, Step-by-Step.

- Data set organisation

-> Pairs of words that appear in ROS forms in English and their translation in Swahili 

what we need is a page like this: except, the phrases will be ROS forms english phrases to another language. 


task 1:
1. find the common english phrases in the ros form that you will transalte.
- first transalte the medical terms found in the ROS form.
- transalte the pharases in the ROS form
- use google transalte for the phrases 
- use a downloaded pdf of words found in the ROS form as the english words
- transfer those words to a doc and find their swhahili tranaltion
- transafer the phrases with their swahili transaltion

2. use tabeo to translate the phrases to swahili. https://tatoeba.org/eng/sentences/search?query=what+is+your+name&from=eng&to=swh
3. for each phrase that is transalted, save it to a doc
4. repeat these steps for several languages and save them on a site so you have something like this http://www.manythings.org/anki/.

the goal is to have common ROS form phrases transalted from one language to another.
these data sets are used to train deep learning models to automatically transalte ROS forms for several languages.

If the models can automatically transalte ROS forms, then we can have programs that are able to aid in Patient to doctor communication in the face of language barrier. 


how does the program work - UI?

1. feed the program with a list of phrases of common english words in ROS forms with the translate version of those phrases. Basically the results from task 1.

2. the program will train the model etc
3. the end result is when you type in a question from the ros form, it automatically translates the question to another language.
4. determine the performance and accuracy of that transaltion.
